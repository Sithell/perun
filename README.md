# Perun

_Perun_ is a Peer-To-Peer Infrastructure-As-A-Service platform

Perun allows you to run code on other peoples machines or let other people run their code on your machine

## Architecture

Perun consists of 3 main components: _Client_, _Manager_ and _Provider_

- Clients request Manager to run their code remotely
- Manager assigns execution of client code to one of the Providers
- Providers run code assigned by Manager and return back the results

## TODO

- [ ] Make a plan
